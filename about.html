                <p class="lead">Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level
                    data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant
                    syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
                    scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

                    The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary
                    form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely
                    distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party
                    Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

                    The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++
                    (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for
                    customizable applications.

                    This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python
                    language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all
                    examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

                    For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python
                    Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++,
                    read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are
                    also several books covering Python in depth.

                    This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every
                    commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will
                    give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read
                    and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python
                    library modules described in The Python Standard Library.</p>
